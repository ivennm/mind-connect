We were just talking about the fact that you're feeling sad, and that it's okay to feel that way. I was offering you a safe space to explore those feelings and reminding you to be kind to yourself. I asked if you wanted to share more about what's making you sad, but emphasized that you don't have to if you don't feel ready. We were also just taking a moment to breathe together, to help calm and center you.
